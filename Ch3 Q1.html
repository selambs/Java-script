        joined this school and moved to Fairfield.I used to work as a cashier in a gift shop. I came to America by my
        self and i don"t have any family memeber here. All my families live in Ethiopia. Life wasn't easy for me to stay
        longer here, but I am still living here after making several descisionss with some experiences. We call this in
        our Sceince and Technology Consciousness cousre, Paradigme shift. It is not only a science, also a part of our
        daily life. </p>
    <p>Now,I am a Master's stundent of Maharishi univesity of management in Software Development. My background is Civil
        Engineering but I am very interested in computer and related things. I worked as an assistant lecturer in a

        school, I took the basic computer skill classes and improved my skill.In higher education level, after I joined
        the engineering school I have taken engineering software training, introduction to C++ and also certified with
        IT Essentials from online Cisco networking academy. Then, I also took a short term training in Georgia given by
        volunteer programmers for refugees and get certified with a title of Introduction to Basic HTML and CSS. So,
        this is my first Javascript. I hope I will be doing my best and enjoy this course. </p>
